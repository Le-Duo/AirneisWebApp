      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>In the heart of Scotland, where the whispers of the past meet the innovations of the future, ÀIRNEIS was born. Our name, meaning "furniture" in Scottish Gaelic, is a tribute to our roots and a symbol of our commitment to bringing the dreams of Scotland's most visionary designers to life. Our collection is a curated symphony of timeless classics and modern masterpieces, each piece crafted with love, care, and unparalleled attention to detail.</p>
      <p>From our humble beginnings as a small, family-run business, ÀIRNEIS has always been more than just a furniture company. It's a legacy of craftsmanship, a celebration of Scottish heritage, and a journey of innovation. We started by sharing our creations through mail order and a handful of partner retailers, cherishing every connection made, every piece that found a new home.</p>
      <p>Embracing the winds of change, we've recently taken a bold step into the digital world with the launch of our online store. This new chapter allows us to weave our stories into the fabric of homes around the globe, connecting with those who share our passion for design that transcends time and borders. It's an invitation to discover the perfect piece that speaks to you, to bring a piece of Scotland into your life.</p>
      <p>Your joy and satisfaction fuel our journey, and we are here to guide, inspire, and listen. Welcome to ÀIRNEIS, a place where tradition dances with innovation, and every piece tells a story waiting to become a part of yours.</p>
      <p>With heartfelt warmth,</p>
      <p>The ÀIRNEIS Family</p>
